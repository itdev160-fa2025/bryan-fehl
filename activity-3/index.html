                <p class="review-text">I've been really impressed with this device since i've got it.  
                    It's not outrageously expensive like some other bluetooth headsets i've used, but still has really good quality.  
                    I was particularly impressed with how long the battery lasts.  The only downside is that the voice quality isn't great.
                    If you're just using it for the audio though, its a fantastic device.

                <p class="review-text">I've been meaning to write this review for a while.  I received this as a gift from my friend, and I've been very happy with it.
                    The battery life has gotten worse over time. When i first got it i would need to charge it maybe once a week, but now its almost ever day.  
                    I suppose that's normal for batteries, but still disappointing.  Overall its good quality for the price.
