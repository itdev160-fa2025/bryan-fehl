                Wikipedia describes the show as
                <blockquote>
                    "a British television show where teams of contestants build a working machine that can perform a specific task, using materials available in a scrapyard"<sup>[1]</sup>

                The show ran from 1998 to 2008, and was originally based on a British television show called Scrapheap Challenge with the same concept.  Teams of 2 or more contestants competed against each other to build machines out of scrap.  
                The machines ranged in complexity from boats and crushing machines to fully functioning planes and cars.  The constestants are given a short amount of time (typically 1 to 2 days) to build these machines, and the show follows the process
                of the teams planning, building, and executing the machines.
